        <h1>Combat Basics</h1>

        <h2>BRV Attacks</h2>

        <p>BRV Attacks steal BRV from the opponents. If the opponent has less than 0 BRV, that's called a Break. That gives BRV to everyone. BRV Attacks don't do any Damage.</p>

        <h2>HP Attacks</h2>

        <p>HP Attacks attack the enemy and does damage. Depending on how much BRV you have is how strong you attack. Say for example you have 5113 BRV, you do 5113 HP Damage. HP Attack +/++/+++ steal BRV and do an HP Attack.</p>

        <h2>Special Moves</h2>

        <p>Special Moves are attacks that sometimes do multiple BRV Attacks, Or do multiple BRV Attacks, and then a HP Attack. Each character's special move does something different from everyone. You can get another special move when you reach Crystal Level 20. Each Special Move has limited amounts of use.</p>

        <h2>EX Moves</h2>

        <p>If you obtain a characters EX weapon you will be able to equip there EX Move. You can't use EX Moves right away, it has to charge up. The way to charge it up is to use a character's special move, if you use a EX Move multiple times it gets stronger every time you use it, and other EX Move can become a Combo. Combos basically let's you use the EX Move, right after you use it the first time. You can also use a Book of Ruin's Mysteries to realize an EX Weapon, and use Ruin's Adamantine Ingots to Limit Break the EX Weapon and make the EX Move stronger.</p>

        <h2>LD Abilities</h2>

        <p>LD Abilities are moves that have 3 uses, they are very strong. Each LD Ability can do different things, whenever someone get's a event they get an LD Weapon. An LD weapon is weaker than an EX+ Weapon (A Realized EX Weapon), you cannot realize LD Weapons.</p>

        <h2>Burst</h2>

        <p>Burst Weapons, gives a character the ability to Burst. A character gets 6 free turns in a Burst that doesn't count to the turn count. So buffs and debuffs don't go down. The final turn in a Burst, makes you use a Burst Move, a very, very powerful attack. When a Burst is done, you get a Burst effect for 4 turns. So far, only main character's and main villains get Bursts.</p>

        <h2>Ability Recover Up</h2>

        <p>Ability Recover ups has only one use, and gives another use of a move. It only gives a use to a character's main Special Move and the Crystal Level 20 Move, it doesn't give a use of an LD Ability. Some gives buff to the character. Like Squall, he gains a Attack Buff when he uses "Ability Recovery Attack Up".</p>
